# ShowerPower
This project is still in development. I'll be trying to keep a blog up to date with upcoming changes. Feedback is always appreciated. 

## About
Shower Power is an automated shower system that runs on an arduino nano to read a series of sensors and controls water valves to provide a great showering experience. The arduino will also broadcast it's status through a USB port to any system running the included node server. The node server then hosts a web interface that could be used through either a touch interface, mobile phone. Again it's early stages but eventually could add support for Google home voice commands and whatever else one wants. Idea being the arduino only responsible for operating the control logic and physical hardware, while another system communicates via usb for the interface to ensure stable operation.
